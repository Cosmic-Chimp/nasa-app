## Nasa APOD API Project

This is a project I was inspired to do when I was preparing for a job interview and realized that I had no experience with api's and working with them.

I decided to mimick the experience of a UAP (a.k.a a ufo) that takes you to space and provides you with information about space.The UAP is supposed to look similar to the tic-tac UAP that Commander David Fravor witnessed in 2004.

I watched a youtube video by [Kapehe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWv30KwbtChjAZBzZ58OQww) and refactored her react-built-in fetch api code using axios. You can view the two different approaches in the NasaPic.js file.

## Technologies & Tools used:
